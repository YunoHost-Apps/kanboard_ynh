## Overview
Kanboard is a visual task manager that makes it easy to manage small projects in a collaborative way. The tool is particularly suitable for people who use the Kanban method. Kanboard can be seen as a (Simplified) alternative to the proprietary Trello software. Kanboard is a minimalist software, it focuses only on the features that are really necessary. The user interface is simple and clear. The tool is designed to run on a small machine such as a Raspberry Pi or a Virtual Private Server (VPS). There are no external dependencies, drag and drop of tasks uses the new HTML5 APIs.

**Shipped version:** 1.2.17

## Limitations

## Additional information

### How to connect as external (non-SSOwat) users

You have to edit this file `/var/www/kanboard/config.php`, find the line `define('REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH', true);` and change it from `true` to `false`.
**Warning** this disables the possibility to connect with SSOwat users. You will *only* be able to connect with Kanboard users created inside of Kanboard.
Then you can connect.

**NB**: if you don't make that change, you will get the following error message "Access Forbidden".

This is due to a Kanboard limitation.
